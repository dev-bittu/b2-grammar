In **mylang**, a dictionary is a collection used to store data in key-value pairs. Here's an overview of how dictionaries work in mylang:

### Creating a Dictionary
A dictionary is created using curly brackets `{}` with key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and they are separated by a colon `:`.

Example:
```mylang
thisdict := {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
```
You can also use the `dict()` constructor to create a dictionary:
```mylang
thisdict := dict(name = "Bittu", age = 36, country = "India")
print(thisdict)
```

### Key Features of Dictionaries
- **Ordered**: In mylang 3.7 and later, dictionaries are ordered, meaning the items will maintain the order they were inserted. In versions before 3.7, dictionaries were unordered.
- **Changeable**: You can change, add, or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
- **No Duplicates**: Each key in a dictionary must be unique. If a key appears more than once, the last value assigned to that key will overwrite any previous value.

### Accessing Dictionary Items
You can access the values in a dictionary by using the key name.
Example:
```mylang
print(thisdict["brand"])  // Outputs: Ford
```

### Modifying a Dictionary
You can change values, add new key-value pairs, or delete items from the dictionary.
Example of changing a value:
```mylang
thisdict["year"] = 2024
```

### Dictionary Length
To find the number of items in a dictionary, use the `len()` function:
```mylang
print(len(thisdict))  // Outputs the number of key-value pairs
```

### Data Types in Dictionaries
The values in a dictionary can be of any data type, such as strings, integers, booleans, lists, etc.
Example:
```mylang
thisdict := {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
```

### Important Notes
- **Keys** must be immutable (strings, numbers, or tuples).
- **Values** can be of any data type, including lists, other dictionaries, or sets.
  
### Example of Overwriting Values
If a key appears more than once, the last value assigned will overwrite the previous one:
```mylang
thisdict := {
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)  // Outputs: {"year": 2020}
```

### `type()` Function
You can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a dictionary:
```mylang
print(type(thisdict))  // Outputs: <class 'dict'>
```

In **mylang**, dictionaries are a powerful way to store and manage data, with an easy-to-understand syntax and robust functionality for managing key-value pairs.
