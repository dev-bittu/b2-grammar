### Writing "Hello, World!" in mylang  

The "Hello, World!" program is a simple way to demonstrate the basic syntax of *mylang*.  

### Example  
```mylang
package main

def main() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Explanation  
1. **`package main`**  
   Declares the main package, which is the entry point for *mylang* programs.  

2. **`def main()`**  
   Defines the `main` function. This is the starting point of the program, where execution begins.  

3. **`print("Hello, World!")`**  
   Outputs the string `"Hello, World!"` to the console.  

This example shows the simplicity and readability of *mylang*, resembling Python's style while maintaining the structure of a compiled language.
